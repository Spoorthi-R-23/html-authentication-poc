This project contains 5 HTML pages demonstrating a basic authentication flow.

Pages:

- login.html : It is used to redirect to the dashboard page.
- register.html : Used when you are a new user and wanted to register.
- forgot-password.html : When the password is forgotten then you r redirected here and later to reset page.
- reset-password.html : This will reset ur password and redirect you to the login page.
- dashboard.html : This is the final page after u login in and u also have an option to log out.

All redirections are done using anchor tags.
